REFLECTION:



While making this website I encountered some miscellaneous issues regarding to the setup of the Django project and the push of the said project to GitHub. First, I got errors regarding to utf-8 but turns out it doesn't support apostrophe (') thus giving that error when running the project. Second, was the push of the project to GitHub, it did not push because of the .vs dependencies being included in the repo, but i fixed it by adding .gitignore on the said dependencies. Lastly was the log in process of GitHub, some of the last discussion was not encountered and explained like logging in to confirm the git push command (They do not use passwords anymore), I fixed it by receiving a authentication code from my emails instead, there's a token option but that seems unnecessary for a small project, and also it did not work on my end.



Overall, I have completed week 1 assignments and finished the project from what I possibly can. I learned some insights of what to do and basically the basics of creating a project from Django. I should probably study more about git and GitHub because of how confusing the system is and I will study more intensively on how Django behaves on my project.
